  <abstract format="text/plain" language="en" script="Latn">This Standard defines the structure and content of well-known text strings describing coordinate reference systems (CRSs) and coordinate operations between coordinate reference systems. It does not prescribe how implementations should read or write these strings.

This Standard provides an updated version of WKT representation of coordinate reference systems that follows the provisions of ISO 19111:2019. It extends the WKT in OGC document 12-063r5 (ISO 19162) which was based on ISO 19111:2007 and ISO 19111-2:2009. That version consolidated several disparate versions of earlier WKT (so-called WKT1) and added the description of coordinate operations.

This jointly developed draft has been submitted by ISO TC211 for circulation as a Draft International Standard (DIS). This version incorporates comments made during the ISO TC211 New Work Item Proposal acceptance ballot.</abstract>
