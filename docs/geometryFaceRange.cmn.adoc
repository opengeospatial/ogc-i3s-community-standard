== geometryFaceRange

`faceRange` is an inclusive range of faces in this geometry that belongs
to this feature.

For each feature, `faceRange` indicates its first and last triangles as
a pair of integer indices in the face list.

*Notes*: - link:geometryFeatureID.cmn.adoc[`featureID`] attribute is
required - This attributes is only supported when topology is `triangle`
- Vertices in the geometry buffer must be grouped by `feature_id` - for
_un-indexed triangle meshes_, `vertex_index = face_index * 3`

*Example*

image:../images/faceRange.png[width=400,align="center"]

_Mesh with 2 features._

image:../images/faceRange_Triangles.png[width=800,align="center"]

_Grouped vertices in the geometry buffer._
