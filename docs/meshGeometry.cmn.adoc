== meshGeometry

Mesh geometry for a node.

NOTE: This class was new in Version 1.2. However, this class is optional. Implementations of previous versions (1.0 and 1.1) will still work.

|===
|Property |Type |Description
|*definition* |integer |The index in
link:geometryDefinition.cmn.adoc[layer.geometryDefinitions] array

|*resource* |integer |The resource locator to be used to query geometry
resources:
`layers/0/nodes/{this.resource}/geometries/{layer.geometryDefinitions[this.definition].geometryBuffers[0 or 1]}`.

|vertexCount |integer |Number of vertices in the geometry buffer of this
mesh for the *umcompressed mesh buffer*. Please note that `Draco`
compressed meshes may have less vertices due to de-duplication (actual
number of vertices is part of the Draco binary blob). Default=`0`

|featureCount |integer |Number of features for this mesh. Default=`0`.
(Must omit or set to `0` if mesh doesnâ€™t use `features`.)
