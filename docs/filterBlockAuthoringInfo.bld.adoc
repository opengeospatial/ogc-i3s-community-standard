== filterBlockAuthoringInfo [building profile]

The filter authoring info object contains metadata about the authoring process for creating a filter block object. This allows the authoring client to save specific, overridable settings. The next time it is accessed via an authoring client, their selections are remembered. Non-authoring clients can ignore it.
