== Point Cloud Scene Layer

Point cloud scene layers quickly display large volumes of symbolized and
filtered point cloud data. They are optimized for the displaying and
sharing a variety of sensor data, including LiDAR.

Point cloud scene layers are scalable, which allows for efficiency when
working with large datasets. While rendering very large point cloud
datasets can be slow and limited by hardware, point cloud scene layers
are efficient because they are rendered at an optimized point resolution
for the specified area.

Point cloud scene layers also support caching attributes like RGB,
Intensity, Flags, Class Code, Returns, User Data, Point Source ID, GPS
Time, Scan Angle and Near Infrared. This allows client applications to
update the symbology as well as query point information.

=== Point Cloud Scene Layer Structure

The point cloud scene layer is structured into a tree of multiple JSON
files. Point cloud scene layers can be represented as a scene layer
package (_.slpk) or an I3S service. Since an _.slpk file can contain
millions of documents, an link:slpk_hashtable.pcsl.md[SLPK hash table]
improves performance when scanning the slpk. A point cloud scene layer
contains the following:

* link:layer.pcsl.adoc[Layer description]
* Nodes containing link:defaultGeometrySchema.pcsl.adoc[Geometry] and
link:attributeInfo.pcsl.adoc[Attributes]
* link:nodePageDefinition.pcsl.adoc[Node pages]
* link:statistics.pcsl.adoc[Statistics]
