|Property |Type |Description
|*renderer* | |An object defining the symbology for the layer. There are many possible types and rules for rendering point clouds. Examples are defineing the color of each point in a Point Cloud based on the value of a color attribute or defineing the color of each point in a Point Cloud based on the value of a numeric attribute. The latter approach allows the client to easily map continuous color ramps to minimum and maximum data values of one of the layer's numeric attribute fields.

=== Examples

==== Example: drawingInfo

In the following example, the _pointCloudSplatAlgorithm_ renders points
using sizes depending on point density. The _pointCloudStretchRenderer_
defines the color of each point in the data such as a point cloud Layer
based on the value of a numeric attribute. They allow the user to easily
map continuous color ramps to minimum and maximum data values of one of
the layerâ€™s numeric attribute fields.
