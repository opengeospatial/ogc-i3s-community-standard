== drawingInfo [common profiles]

DrawingInfo and the associated classes contain the default symbology (drawing information) of an Indexed 3D Scene Layer. When the DrawingInfo object is present in the 3dSceneLayerInfo Class, a client application may symbolize an I3S layer by utilizing the *Renderer* information. Indexed 3d Scene Layers also supports capturing the DrawingInfo object as part of the binary I3S representation This is to support applications that may not be able to dynamically symbolize/override a given I3S layer based on its drawing information. Such a behavior, when present, is indicated by the CachedDrawingInfo Class, indicating the component of the DrawingInfo object thatâ€™s captured as part of the binary I3S representation. The Class DrawingInfo has the following structure:
