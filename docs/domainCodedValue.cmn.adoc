== domainCodedValue

Quite often in a controlled vocabulary, such as in a land use classification, coded values are used to represent categories of a feature. For example, "Res" could refer to Residential. The domainCodedValue class allows for the specification of these codes values. Attribute domains are rules that describe the legal values of a field type, providing a method for enforcing data integrity. 

More specifically, attribute domains
are used to constrain the values allowed in any particular attribute.
Whenever a domain is associated with an attribute field, only the values
within that domain are valid for the field. Using domains helps ensure
data integrity by limiting the choice of values for a particular field.
The domain code value contains the coded values for a domain as well as
an associated description of what that value represents.
