== 3D Object Scene Layer (1.3)

A 3D object scene layer is used to visualize 3D objects. 3D object scene
layers are often created from GIS data with attributes and explicitly
modeled in 3D. These attributes allow definition queries to specify
symbology and other properties in lieu of setting properties for each
object individually. A 3D object scene layer can efficiently create and
share just a few buildings or an entire city.

=== 3D Object Scene Layer Structure

The 3D object scene layer is structured into a tree of multiple JSON
files. A 3D object scene layer can be represented as a scene layer
package (*.slpk) or an I3S service. A 3D object scene layer contains the
following:

* link:3DSceneLayer.cmn.adoc[3DSceneLayer]
* link:nodePage.cmn.adoc[nodePage]
* geometryBuffer (binary)
* attributesBuffer (binary)
* textures (binary)
* link:statsInfo.cmn.adoc[statistics]
* link:3DNodeIndexDocument.cmn.adoc[3DNodeIndexDocument]*
* link:sharedResource.cmn.adoc[sharedResource]*
* features^

3D object scene layer packages can optionally contain a
link:slpk_hashtable.cmn.adoc[hash table] for faster indexing.

_* Only required for OGC version 1.1 compatability for older clients._ 

_Not used by client. Human readable version of the features._

== HTTP API Overview 1.2

Version 1.3 is backwards compatible with 1.1 and 1.2. For older clients to be
able to read version 1.3 encodings, sharedResources and the 3DNodeIndexDocument resources
are included.

The following API methods are available for 3D Object scene layer:

*Scene layer document*
