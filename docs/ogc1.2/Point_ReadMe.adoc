== Point Scene Layer (OGC Version 1.2)

Point scene layers contain point features and their attributes. Point
scene layers are often used to visualize large amounts of 3D data like
trees or buildings. Most phenomena that can be visualized by 3D symbols
can be displayed with a point scene layers.

=== Point Scene Layer Structure

The point scene layer is structured into a tree of multiple JSON files.
Point scene layers can be represented as a scene layer package (*.slpk)
or a I3S service. A point scene layer contains the following:

* link:3DSceneLayer.psl.adoc[3DSceneLayer]
* link:featureData.cmn.adoc[featureData]
* attribute (binary)
* link:3DNodeIndexDocument.cmn.adoc[3DNodeIndexDocument]
* link:statisticsInfo.cmn.adoc[statistics]
