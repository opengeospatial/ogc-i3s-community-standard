==	geometryReferenceParams

Instead of owning a Geometry exclusively, a Feature can also reference a (or part of a) Geometry defined for the node. This allows pre-aggregating Geometries for many features. In this case, a GeometryReferenceParams has to be used.

|Name	|Type	|Description
|*href*	|String	|In-document absolute reference to full geometry definition (Embedded or ArrayBufferView) using the I3S json pointer syntax.
|Type	|String	|The type denotes whether the following geometry is defined by using array buffer views (ArrayBufferView), as an internal reference (GeometryReference), as a reference to a shared Resource (SharedResourceReference) or embedded (Embedded).
|faceRange	|Number[2]	|Inclusive range of faces in this geometry that belongs to this feature.
|lodGeometry	|Boolean	|True if this geometry participates in a LoD tree. This value SHALL always be true for the mesh-pyramids profile.
