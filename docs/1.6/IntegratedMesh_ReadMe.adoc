=== Integrated Mesh Scene Layer

Integrated mesh scene layers are generally created for citywide 3D mapping. Integrated mesh scene layers include an entire surface and cannot be restyled. Three-dimensional mesh data are typically captured by an automated process (e.g. drone) for constructing 3D objects out of large sets of overlapping imagery. The result integrates the original input image information as a textured mesh including 3D objects, such as buildings and trees, and elevation information.

==== 9.2.1	Integrated Mesh Scene Layer Structure
The Integrated Mesh scene layer is structured into a tree of multiple JSON files. Besides storing information in the JSON format, some are also provided as binary buffer. Integrated mesh scene layers can be used to create a scene layer package (*.slpk) or an I3S service. An Integrated Mesh scene layer _SHALL_ contain profiles of the following classes:

- Layer description (See Class 3DSceneLayerInfo Common Profile)
- Nodes containing Geometry, Feature Data, and Texture
- Shared Resources

Please visit Annex H for more details on the Integrated Mesh Layer Profile as well as a JSON example.
