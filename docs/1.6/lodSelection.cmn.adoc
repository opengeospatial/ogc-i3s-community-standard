== lodSelection

(Was 7.6.4.5 in the OGC V1.1 document)

A LodSelection object provides information on a given metric determined during the cooking process of an I3S store. This metric can be used by the client to determine whether a representation is of the right quality level for rendering or whether a different representation is needed.

Publishers (aka “cookers”) can add as many LodSelection objects as desired but must provide one as soon as the layer's lodType is not null. Of the three min/avg/max values, typically only one or two are used.

*Please Note: In version 1.1, the maxValue, avgValue, and minValue properties have been deprecated.* The deprecated properties are highlighted in red. This deprecated elements will remain in the OGC I3S Community Standard until such time as Version 2 of this Community Standard is approved. At that time, these deprecated elements will be removed from the standard.
