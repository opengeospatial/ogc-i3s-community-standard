[big]*i.     Abstract*

The Indexed 3D Scene Layer (I3S) format is an open 3D content delivery
format used to rapidly stream and distribute large volumes of 3D GIS
data to mobile, web and desktop clients. I3S content can be shared
across enterprise systems using both physical and cloud servers.

A single I3S data set, referred to as a Scene Layer, is a container for
arbitrarily large amounts of heterogeneously distributed 3D geographic
data. Scene Layers are designed to be used in mobile, desktop, and
server-based workflows and can be accessed over the web or as local
files.

The delivery format and persistence model for Scene Layers, referred to
as Indexed 3d Scene Layer (I3S) and Scene Layer Package (SLPK)
respectively, are specified in detail in this OGC Community Standard.
Both formats are encoded using JSON and binary ArrayBuffers (ECMAScript
2015). I3S is designed to be cloud, web and mobile friendly. I3S is
based on JSON, REST and modern web standards and is easy to handle,
efficiently parse and render by Web and Mobile Clients. I3S is designed
to stream large 3D datasets and is designed for performance and
scalability. I3S is designed to support 3D geospatial content and
supports the requisite coordinate reference systems and height models in
conjunction with a rich set of layer types.

GitHub repository in the future.

Please note that the Esri I3S Github repository includes a Building
Scene Layer (e.g. comprehensive building model including building
components). This layer type is not included in this OGC Community
Standard but may be proposed for inclusion in a future version.

[big]*iii. Validity of content*

The Submission Team has reviewed and certified that the `snapshot`
content in this Community Standard is true and accurate. The `snapshot` for OGC I3S Version 1.2 was taken on .

[big]*vi. Preface*

I3S originated from investigations into technologies for rapidly
streaming and distributing large volumes of 3D content across enterprise
systems that may consist of server components, cloud hosted components,
and a variety of client software from desktop to web and mobile
applications.

Policies and Procedures:

* Any http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/community[Community
Standard] submission requires that three or more distinct Member
organizations support the submission. In addition to the submission team
lead, each other organization supporting the submission shall provide
the TCC with an email stating their organization’s support of the
submission.

[big]*vi. Future Work* The I3S community anticipates that revisions to this
Community Standard will be required to prescribe content appropriate to
meet new use cases. These use cases may arise from either (or both) the
external user and developer community or from OGC review and comments.
Further, future revisions will be driven by any submitted change
requests that document community uses cases and requirements.

Currently, the following layer type may be considered for future
inclusion in the I3S standard (future work):

* Building Scene Layer (e.g. comprehensive building model including
building components)
