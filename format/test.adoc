==== Node resources 

In addition to a bounding volume, each node contains references to node
resources. The type of resource available, such as geometry buffer,
texture and attribute, depends on the original data and layer type.
Clients must use the resource identifiers (id) written in each node to
access the resources. While content creators may choose to match a
resource id with the node id this is not required by the I3S
specification. As such, clients should not make this assumption.
